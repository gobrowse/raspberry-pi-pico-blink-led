Getting started with raspberry pi pico and blink onboard LED
In this project we will be setting up the raspberry pi pico and blink it's onboard LED. We will be setting up the raspberry pi pico on windows and on raspberry pi OS.
***
windows:
1. go to [thonny.org](https://thonny.org/)
2. install thonny
3. open thonny for the first time

6. then pressing the BOOTSEL button plug in your raspberry pi pico into your computer.
for more information go to [raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/)

7. go to thonny

8. in thonny press the "switch to regular mode"

10. go to interpreter and change the interpreter to micropython (Raspberry Pi Pico) and then press install or update firmware

11. after you install the firmware download [blink.py](https://github.com/gobrowse/raspberry-pi-pico-experiments/blob/main/blink.py) and run it in thonny!
 
12. watch your raspberry pi Pico onboard LED blink!

Raspberry pi OS:
We are still making the tutorial
